# Facial-Recognition
Recognizing faces in an image and predicting age, gender and emotion using Tensorflow.
### Approach:
#### First Step:
Building model(s) for age, gender and emotion detection and improving accuracy
#### Second Step:
Implementing a face detection model using Tensorflow Object Detection API.

### Dataset:
[CKPLUS](https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/ckplus) dataset for emotion classification <br>
[UTKFace](https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new) dataset for age and gender classification <br>
